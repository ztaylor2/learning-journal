# LJ Code 201 - Day 19

On day 19 of class I learned about building a nav bar, a dropdown menu, connecting pages, and organizing project files.  We started the project out just saving our index, CSS, and html pages all in the home directory of the project.  A couple days later our home directory had around 30 files in it.  So, I had to back track and organize these files into CSS, html, and JS folders.  It would have been better to start off the project with those folders, which I will definitely do in the future.
