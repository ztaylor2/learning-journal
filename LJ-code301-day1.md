# LJ Code 301 - Day 3

***

Today our lab covered the basic components that go into a jQuery SPA.  It was a difficult but rewarding lab.  The part we struggled on the most was adding an event listener to the entire section, then pointing it towards specific elements in that section with an argument in the event listener.  

After struggling through the lab I was able to build the same functionality into my portfolio fairly easily.  It is pretty cool how jQuery uses hide and show to build tabs.  All in all it was a good day of learning the basics of SPAs with jQuery.
