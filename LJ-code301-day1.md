# LJ Code 301 - Day 1

###

Today we built responsive wed design functionality into a website.  I'd had a little bit of previous exposer to RWD, but it was great seeing how it is actually implemented professionally.  I am definitely looking forward to building this type of functionality into future websites.  

We also went over MVC which was interesting.  I still have a lot of questions about servers and databases that I look forward to getting answers to.
