# LJ Code 201 - Day 4

Today we learned about functions in JavaScript then we did our first day of peer programing.  Four our lab we implemented functions into our quiz application.  I really enjoyed doing this and it went really well while I was driving.  I found that talking through my code really helped me organize my thoughts and problem solve systematically.  I was able to crank through the lab fairly easily.  I also used arrays throughout my functions which made me more familiar with them.  

All in all, after today I am much more comfortable with functions and arrays.  My coding skills are improving rapidly.
