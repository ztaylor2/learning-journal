# LJ Code 201 - Day 20

***
Today we finished our project completely.  Trying to manage git became very challenging.  In the future I will definitely work harder to manage git workflow.  Some things I'll keep in mind when trying to do this.  

- Everyone should do a merge and pull party as frequently as possible to try to prevent massive merge conflicts.  
- Try to make project modular enough so that people don't have to work in the same file at the same time.  
- Communicate verbally to make sure that everyone is on the same page at the same time.  

Doing these things might make managing git much easier.  At the very least I will not underestimate git issues in the future.
