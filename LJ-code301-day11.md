# LJ Code 301 - Day 11

***

Today we learned the JavaScript library page.js.  Page.js is a really powerful tool that allows us to manipulate the content of the webpage without reloading the page.  It is the basic principle that single page applications are built off of.  Frameworks such as react and angular use identical routing functionality to allow people to build single page applications.  Learning routing was very cool because it is a fairly advanced topic that is frequently used in industry.  

In addition to learning page.js we got to practice our skills with the server and database.  My skills with those things are getting much better, and I look forward to developing them further.
