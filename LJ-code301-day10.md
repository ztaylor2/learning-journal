# LJ Code 301 - Day 8

***

On Friday we introduced ourselves to functional programming.  I found this very interesting because I've heard a lot about functional programming but I've never actually done any.  We used .map to map through the items in an array and we used .reduce to preform a calculation on the array.  At first I got hung up because I *didn't read the docs* and I didn't realize how specific the inputs had to be in the functional programming array methods.  After I figured that out everything was a breeze.  It was a learning experience.  Next time I'm stuck on something I'll be sure to read the documentation carefully.  Regardless, the lab went well and I'm very impressed by what functional programming can accomplish in just a single line of code.
