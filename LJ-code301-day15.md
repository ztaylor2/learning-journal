# LJ Code 301 - Day 15

On day 15 we met with our final project group, decided on a final project, then started working on it.  I was able to build out a basic google maps API and get it populated with locational data of permits from the Seattle city government.  Not all of the data points are populating correctly, it populates the first few, and that's it.  I think that this is because of asynchronous JavaScipt.  I am asking for all of the data but trying to populate the map before all of the data from the AJAX call as arrived, so only the first few are being shown on the map.  I have had a lot of trouble with this sort of thing throughout our labs etc.  My main goal for this next week is to get really good at managing asynchronous JavaScipt so that I perform tasks in the right order after an AJAX call has received all of it's data.
