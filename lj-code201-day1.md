# LJ Code 201 - Day 1

Today we quickly went through html, CSS, and JavaScrip.  We focused on specific aspects of each that cause many people to trip up.  I thought that this was a great approach to teaching us web dev quickly.  I learned many interesting things that I didn't know before, including:

- New HTML5 semantic tags such as header, footer, nav, aside, and main.  It was interesting to note that the web dev community has transitioned from using divs to semantic tags.  
- When to use id's vs classes.  Before today it hadn't occurred to me that id's should be used for specific instances while classes should be used for repeating instances.  Furthermore, that id's will generally be used in tandem with JavaScript while classes will be used with CSS.  
- Many new short cut commands including: command tab to switch applications, command T for making a new tab, command D for highlighting multiple instances of the same word, command arrow to navigate quickly in atom, command f to find and replace words, tab to quickly finish typing things, etc.
- Terminal commands that allow you to navigate through files/directories including: cd, ls, mv, rm, touch, etc.  
- Git terminal commands: add, commit, push

All in all my proficiency as a software developer improved greatly today.
