# LJ Code 201 - Day 11

Today we got some more practice in with using objects.  I found this repetition very beneficial in helping objects become something that I understand very well.  

We also got some more practice with events today.  After a couple days with events I am beginning to understand them very well.  I feel very comfortable with events and I'm excited to get more experience with them.  

One large improvement that I noticed in my code today was my organization.  I was able to break down my code into many different functions and organize them properly on the page. Additionally, my final application had little to no repetition in it.  Just a week ago I would never have been able to build the bus mall application in one day.  I've seen massive improvement in my coding skills within the past couple weeks.
