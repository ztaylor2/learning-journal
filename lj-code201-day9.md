# LJ Code 201 - Day 9

Today I built the functionality that allows the user to update a row into my salmon cookie table.  It was a good learning process.  It took me a while to work through it but in the end the solutions were simple.  I think I'm starting to get a good grasp on functions, objects, and events and how to organize my JavaScript files.  

Today I also improved my skills with CSS quite a bit.  We had a lot of time to work with CSS and I improved quite a bit just by tinkering around with it.  

We also gave ourselves time to reflect on what we've learned this week. I found this beneficial because of the sheer quantity and importance of what we've learned.  Having time to reflect on how constructor functions and events work allowed them to sink in a little more.
