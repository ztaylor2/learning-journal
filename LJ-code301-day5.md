# LJ Code 301 - Day 5

On day 5 we dove further down into jQuery, and we continued our lab by building a full templating website using jQuery.  We also used another JS library called handlebars.  This library improves the tedious process of DOM manipulation by allowing us to put html into the DOM by putting a variable name between two curly braces.  

The additions of these technologies has improved our buildout process, and it allows us to build much more complicated things easier than using vanilla JavaScript.  I'm excited to learn more JavaScript libraries and tools to make our lives even easier.
