# LJ Code 301 - Day 8

***

Today we learned about how to set up a node server.  I found it very interesting because I know very little about backend development, and it is my goal to become a backend engineer.  We definitely covered a lot of content today but after patiently taking my time and learning most of the aspects of the code I think I have a decent understanding and I feel good about what we've learned.  Here are the steps to start up a server from scratch:
  - create a server.js file in repo
  - command line: npm init
    - fill out info
  - command line: npm i --save <dependencies>
