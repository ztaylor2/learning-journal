# LJ Code 201 - Day 6

Today in class I learned a ton about how to manipulate the DOM.  I didn't know that you could add elements to HTML with JavaScript.  It was great learning and practicing how to do that.  Additionally, today I got a lot of experience with object literals.  I have always heard the term Object Oriented Programming and I've wanted to learn how to do that for quite a while.  Today was a very rewarding day because many of the things that we've learned are starting to come together in a way that allows us to build fully functional applications.  Lastly, my css skills were greatly improved upon today, and I built a UI that I'm proud of.

I'm still getting used to creating branches and pull requests with Git so I'll focus on getting that down within the next couple of days.
