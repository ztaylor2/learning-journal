# LJ Code 301 - Day 6

***

Today we learned about AJAX and JSON.  We learned about the basic structure of how content is loaded into a webpage.  Here are the steps:

- First we check to see if the data we are trying to load remotely is already in local storage.  
  - If it is in local storage load it from local storage.  
  - If it is not in local storage load it remotely then store it into local storage for next time.  

This is the basic template for loading data into pages.
