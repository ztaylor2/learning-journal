# LJ Code 201 - Day 10

Friday we learned about wireframes.  I was skeptical as to how much a wireframe might help my CSS when throwing together UIs but it turned out to be very helpful while building my chocolate pizza UI.  It made writing CSS more of a clear and concise process instead of just throwing content together then trying to organize it.  Doing the organizing first made the whole process easier and resulted in a higher quality UI.  I will use wireframeing before building websites in the future.
