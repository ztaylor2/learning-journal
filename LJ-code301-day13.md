# LJ Code 301 - Day 13

Today we deployed our lab and learning journal with Heroku.  We learned about how the hosting agent will specify a PORT for our server, and how we can imbed access keys into our server so that the user can't access data that we don't want them to.  It is interesting learning about security.  I'm still very curious as to how we ensure that many other things on our websites are secure and I look forward to learning about more security methods.  

The other interesting topic we covered today was how the cycle of deployment works in real companies.  First you deploy a testing deployment and make sure that it won't break, you have people test it, then you deploy it for real.  It's always great hearing about how people actually do things in industry.
